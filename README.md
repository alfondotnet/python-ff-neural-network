Academic
==============

Some things I have recently done academically speaking.

This is an implementation (from scratch) of a FF Neural Network with Momentum for face pattern recognition, and it's tests.

This was a fun and awesome class project proposed by J.Luis Ruiz Reina, inspired in the
work by Tom Mitchell.
